# NUFORC Database Statistics and Analysis




## Data sources

A cleaned NUFORC dataset, covering the beginning through 2014, is available on
Github from @planetsig: https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports/.

For 2015-2020 recoreds, I used the code from Timothy Renner to scrape these
records from the site directly. See his Github repo: https://github.com/timothyrenner/nuforc_sightings_data/.
